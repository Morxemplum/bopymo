# Legacy Code

This is all code that was built for the legacy version of Bopimo (1.0.8 and earlier) before the newly established JSON format was created.

This code relied on Godot's JSON formatting and parsing libraries, which is why a lot of the JSON code seemed bloated.

These libraries are deprecated and will not be updated with new code.
